&lt;form> tags are used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing. A form can include elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons. The &lt;form> tag uses attributes such as action (where the data is sent) and method (how the data is sent, e.g., GET or POST).
